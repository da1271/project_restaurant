#### Intro

Have you ever dealt with not being able to choose which restaurant to eat at?? Well hooray! Random Restaurant will be an app designed to find you a random 4 star restaurant in a set radius around you. Some stretches are being able to search based on a certain cuisine, number of reviews, or number of friends that checked into that location.
