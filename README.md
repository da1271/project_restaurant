#### Approach
This project will consist of two models: API and User. Our API model will include ratings for the components of an API that we previously mentioned (installation difficulty, documentation clarity, API difficulty) and will reveal whether there is support offered (such as an FAQ or a forum), as well as the number of tools offered. Full CRUD will be provided for users to create, edit, update, and delete their profile. For the minimum viable product, the ratings will be determined by the creators of this app, Squad Uno.

#### Stretch Goals
- Allow users to make a favorites list of the APIs they like the most ✓
- Allow users to update their ratings ✓
- Search for API by name ✓
- Enable users with permission to rate the API tools, so that we can provide user-ratings as well as pro-ratings ✗
- Allow users to write reviews on APIs ✗
- Build a user forum for Q&A ✗
- Provide notifications for API updates ✗
- Recommendation of API based on experience level ✗

#### Unsolved Problems
- Admin setup is not finalized. As a workaround, current admin users are hard-coded into our app
- Search bar is currently case-sensitive

#### Installation Instructions
